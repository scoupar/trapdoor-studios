          Trapdoor has been carefully put together so that you feel as
          comfortable and as happy as you can making a record. It's a space that
          allows for the creative process to happen naturally and quickly with
          as little interruptions as possible. Once the door is shut, the
          outside world is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is your
          music.
