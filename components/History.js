        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
          Trapdoor Studios is my recording home in Liverpool, UK. Setup in 2019
          with the help of lots of generous Indiegogo contributions, I’ve slowly
          been turning it into a beautifully creative space to make a record.

          The studio was setup in memory of my dear friend Dan Wild-Beesley who
          passed away in 2018. We always dreamed of having a studio together so
          I couldn’t think of a better way to remember him by.{" "}

          The emphasis is on cosy and comfortable so you can relax and have fun
          recording your music. The live room is nice and big with plenty of
          room to record a full band.
