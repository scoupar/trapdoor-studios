          Trapdoor started as a dream between Tom Peters and Dan Wild-Beesley
          (guitarist in Cleft/GUG and recording engineer) way back in 2013. The
          pair were inseparable and spent most of their time together chatting
          about recording. microphones, bands, amps; everything music related.
          It was only natural that the conversation would move on to opening a
          studio together and in 2014, it very nearly happened.

          Sadly, things fell through and the studio plan had to take a backseat
          when in 2015, Dan fell ill. After several years of lengthy treatment,
          in October 2018, Dan passed away surrounded by his family. He left
          behind a legacy of incredible joy and happiness and is missed
          everyday. Trapdoor Studio is a part of that legacy, named after a
          Cleft song of the same name, it was the best way Tom could think of to
          remember his best friend by - a sacred shrine to all things Dan and a
          place where his creative spirit can live on. Dan may not be with us
          anymore but his presence is felt in every record produced at Trapdoor.

          Trapdoor opened its doors in 2019 and was made possible by the
          generosity of lots of wonderful contributors to the studio's startup
          Indiegogo campaign. Without them, Trapdoor would not have been
          possible. Thank you!
