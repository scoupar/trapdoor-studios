                Tom has over a decade of working experience in capturing and
                producing music. Starting out in 2011 at The Grand Studio in
                rural Lancashire, he has spent the last 10 years working in
                studios all across the UK and Ireland until setting up Trapdoor,

                is on making your music sound like the best representation of
                you; full of life, colour and power whilst preserving the core
                values of your creative expression. In other words, he wants you
                to sound like you.

            Without Dan Wild-Beesley, there would be no Trapdoor. Tom and Dan

            Dan passed away in 2018, leaving behind a legacy of incredible joy
            and happiness and Trapdoor Studio is a tribute to that legacy. Named
            after a Cleft song of the same name, it was the best way Tom could
            think to remember his best friend by - a sacred shrine to all things
            Dan and a place where his creative spirit can live on. Dan may not
            be with us anymore but his presence is felt in every record produced
            at Trapdoor.

            Trapdoor opened its doors in 2019, made possible by the generosity
            of many wonderful contributors to the studio's start-up Indiegogo
            campaign. Without them, Trapdoor would not exist. Thank you!
