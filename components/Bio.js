          Trapdoor Studio is the home of UK Record Producer Tom Peters. Tom has
          over a decade of working experience in capturing and producing music
          to the highest standard. Starting out in 2011 as the assistant at The
          Grand Studio in rural Lancashire, he has spent the last 10 years
          honing his craft, working in studios all across the UK and Ireland
          until setting up Trapdoor in April 2019.

          Tom's production is vibrant and exciting but still natural and human -
          the emphasis is on making your music sound like the best
          representation of you; full of life, colour and power whilst
          preserving the core values of your creative expression. In other
          words, he wants you to sound uniquely like you.
