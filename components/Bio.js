        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I’m Tom Peters, a UK based professional Record Producer and Mix
          Engineer with close to a decade of experience. My clients cover a huge
          array of musical genres and include The Fall, Grace Davies, Vennart,
          Mike Dignam, Vasa, Jeramiah Ferrari, Body Hound, Wot Gorilla?, Cleft
          and The Hyena Kill to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my career as the Studio Assistant at The Grand Studio in
          rural Lancashire back in 2011 and was quickly promoted to Studio
          Manager. I moved on from The Grand in 2017 to set up my own business,
          settling in Liverpool where I built and opened Trapdoor Studio in 2019
          following a short stint working from Liverpool’s highly regarded Motor
          Museum.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also a touring musician playing guitar in Alpha Male Tea Party
          (of which I have produced all our recordings to date).
        </p>
        <p>
          I produce all music as I would like to hear it and in a way that is
          right for the artist. At the root of my production is the desire for
          the individual character and personality of a performance to shine
          through on any recording. In other words, I want you to sound like
          you. When you’re in the studio with me, I want you to have fun. I want
          you to feel completely at ease and be able to completely explore your
          creative spirit. A recording session should be something to look back
          on with great fondness and your recordings should always be a great
          reminder of that.
        </p>
