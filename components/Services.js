          PRODUCTION Producing a record is one of the most challenging but
          enjoyable things a musician can do. The best production sessions will
          take your songs to heights you never thought they could reach and
          leave you with something you can be truly proud of and what could be
          better than that? It’s the most enjoyable part of the process, it’s
          the most creative part and ultimately, the most important so,
          naturally, you need to get it right.

          A great record starts at the source with you and the sounds you make.
          Great production is about translating great songs into a great sonic
          experience and it’s the part where you can have the most fun and learn
          the most about who you are and what being a creative musician really
          means. It’s not about making something ‘commercial’ or ‘current’ or
          whatever industry buzzword happens to come to mind, it’s about you and
          how your music makes you and the listener feel. With every production,
          whether it’s a Folk album, a metal EP or a Pop single, my focus is
          always on getting the best performance out of you. When I say best, I
          don’t mean ‘perfect’ or ‘flawless’ I mean the most quintessentially
          ‘you’. I want you to have fun, to look back at the time you spent in
          the studio and smile because you made something amazing and you loved
          doing it.{" "}

            If that sounds like the way you think about making records, then get
            in touch because we can make something brilliant, I’m dead sure of
            it.
