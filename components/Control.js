        <p>
          The emphasis is on cosy and comfortable. An acoustically treated
          cocoon, the room is designed to sound great wherever you sit. The
          studio is built around the Universal Audio Apollo system with Avid Pro
          Tools and has a whole host of creative tools to capture your music.
        </p>
        <p>
          The monitoring is provided by Neumann and Quested and is accurate and
          powerful so you can guarantee that what you're hearing in the studio
          is what you'll hear at home. It also looks rather handsome too; if
          you've got to sit in it for 10 hours, you want it to feel nice, right?
          We certainly do.
